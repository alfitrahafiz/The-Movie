# THE-MOVIE: Movie Database Project ðŸŽ¬

This project was developed as part of a frontend developer technical test, completed within a 3-day timeframe. It represents my first venture into several key modern web technologies.

## Project Overview

A movie database application that showcases current and upcoming films, utilizing The Movie Database (TMDB) API. This project serves as both a technical assessment and a learning journey into new technologies.

## Tech Stack

- Vite + React
- TypeScript (First-time implementation)
- Tailwind CSS
- Context API (First experience with useContext)
- TMDB API (First project using API KEY integration)

## Key Features

- ðŸŒ“ Dark/Light mode toggle
- ðŸ“± Responsive design
- ðŸ”„ State management using Context API

## Learning Journey & Future Improvements

This project represents several "firsts" in my development journey:

- First time working with TypeScript in a React project
- Initial exploration of Context API for state management
- First experience integrating an external API with API KEY

### Areas for Future Enhancement

I acknowledge that this project is a work in progress with room for improvement in:

- Folder structure organization
- Component architecture
- Code optimization
- TypeScript implementation

This project will continue to be refined as I enhance my portfolio and deepen my understanding of these technologies.

## Development Timeline

- Duration: 3 days
- Status: Basic functionality complete, ongoing refinements planned

## Note

This project was created as part of a technical assessment for a frontend developer position. While it meets the basic requirements, I plan to continue improving it as part of my learning journey and portfolio development.
